*****Read me for Project 3*****
I have done my Project 3, that is, implementing logistic regression on MATLAB2015Ra
There are 3 matlab files
1.FftFinal.m
2.MfccFinal.m
3.Top20.m
The FftFinal.m is the fft model where the fourier transform is used for extracting the induvidual frequency intensities.
The resultant matrix is fed into the logistic regression model.
The MfccFinal.m is the model, where in the mel frequency coefficients are used. 
Top20.m is the program for extracting the top 20 fft features. Here, we use the standard deviation concept for 
selecting the best features. this method does not give a good accuracy and hence its not a good method to 
select the features.

For calculating MFCC i have used the mfcc zip file 

For executing the program, the location of the files must be chnaged to the appropriate location
so that 'file not found' error does not pop up.
